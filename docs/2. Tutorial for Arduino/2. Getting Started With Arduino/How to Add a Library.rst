2. How to Add a Library?
========================

What are Libraries ?

Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect
to a sensor,display, module, etc.

For example, the built-in LiquidCrystal library helps talk to LCD
displays. There are hundreds of additional libraries available on the
Internet for download.

The built-in libraries and some of these additional libraries are listed
in the reference.

Here we will introduce the most simple way for you to add libraries .

Step 1 : After downloading well the Arduino IDE, you can right-click the
icon of Arduino IDE.

Find the option "Open file location" shown as below:

Step2: Enter it to find out libraries folder which is the library file
of Arduino.

Step3：Next to find out the “libraries” of smart home(seen in the
link:https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS0085),as shown below:

You just need to replicate and paste\ |image-20250416135911854|\ in to
the libraries folder of Arduino IDE.

The library of smart home is successfully installed,as shown below:
